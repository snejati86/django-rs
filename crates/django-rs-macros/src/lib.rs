//! # django-rs-macros
//!
//! Procedural macros for the django-rs framework. Provides derive macros and attribute
//! macros for models, views, forms, URL routing, and other framework components.
//!
//! This crate is independent of all other django-rs crates because proc-macro crates
//! cannot depend on crates that use them.

// Proc macro implementations will be added as features are implemented
